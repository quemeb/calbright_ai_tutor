I want to select more than one or two rows, in fact, I want to select up to my current row, so I select Up to current row, 3. Once I've frozen the rows, I now see a light gray line denoting the frozen rows. Now when I scroll the spreadsheet, those top three rows stay visible. To unfreeze those rows, I'll go back to that View menu, select Freeze and select No rows. Now, when I scroll through the spreadsheet those rows are no longer frozen. It's a similar process for freezing columns. I'll show you on this solar panel chart. I'd like to keep the first column visible as I scroll through the other columns. To freeze columns select View, Freeze, and select the number of columns you'd like to freeze. I'll select freeze 1 column.

First, let's talk about hiding and unhiding rows on a spreadsheet. I'll show you how using the sunshine and location chart. This file is titled hide in the exercise files chapter four folder. I've decided I went to hide the data for Alaska. So I'll select rows four and five, right click, and select hide rows four and five. When I click away from that and hover, I see that a small icon with an up and down arrow appears where rows four and five are hidden. If I click on that icon, the rows appear again. We can also hide columns. I'll hide some extraneous columns on this solar panel chart. To hide a column, right click or control click the letter or letters of the column or columns that you want to hide. Select hide column from the dropdown menu that appears. I'll select columns D and E, and I'll select hide columns D and E. Again, we see the double arrow icon where",

So I'm going to clear all and select lightbulb, and click okay. Now you see that only the rows with lightbulb in column F are showing. The rest are hidden. You'll also see that the icon in the hetero has changed to a tiny filter, instead of that inverted triangle, to show that data is being filtered. I'll remove this filter by clicking on the Filter icon and turning off the filter. You can also create a filter on multiple columns at once.

Keep in mind that when you enable a filter, it filters the data for any viewers and collaborators on your sheet. Any editor will have the permissions to change the filter. If you want to save a filter that you can use over and over again, try creating a filter view. I'll use this existing filter setting and save it as a filter view I can access later. To do that, I'll click Data, Filter views, Save as filter view. The filter view is signified by dark gray highlighting your column and row headers, as well as a line above the column headers with the name and range of your filter. Since this filter is on chargers sold on March 1st, I'll name this \"Charger sold March 1st\" by clicking and revising the filter view name in the top left corner.

Sorting data on a spreadsheet https://www.linkedin.com/learning/google-sheets-essential-training-2021/sorting-data-on-a- spreadsheet?u=24867419 Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video - [Instructor] In Google Sheets, you can sort your data based on rules you set for one or more columns. You can sort a column so that the other columns in this spreadsheet are sorted along with it, or you can sort a column on its own. You can also start multiple columns in priority order. Sorting columns can be handy for looking at your data in different ways quickly without setting up filter views or pivot tables. Let me show you how sorting columns works in Google Sheets. I'll show you on this sales spreadsheet. You'll find this as the file named \"Sort\" in the \"Exercise Files Chapter Four\" folder. Most commonly, you'll want to sort your spreadsheet on a single column, and you'll want to have the other columns in the spreadsheet sorted along with it, so you don't mess up your data.

This may occur if you have a column that's unrelated to the rest of this spreadsheet For example, on this \"New Item\" spreadsheet, If I want to sort the items in this column but leave the other columns as they are, I'd select the column, select \"Data,\" select \"Sort Range,\" select \"Data Has a Header Row,\" and I'll select \"Z through A,\" just for that column. And only that column sorts in reverse alphabetical order. Notice that the other columns on the spreadsheet remain unchanged. Only column G was sorted. Remember, select \"Sort Range\" If you only want one column to be sorted and the rest of the columns to remain unchanged. 2.0 E: Quiz | Viewing Spreadsheets (2 pts) https://calbright.instructure.com/courses/336/assignments/7629?module_item_id=27368 Type: Quiz Content: You have six attempts for this assessment.

To add conditional formatting, set up a rule that would change the formatting of each cell that meets certain conditions. Let's walk through the process of creating a conditional formatting rule, and look at how it works. I'll show you on this sales data spreadsheet.

So first, I'll select the whole percent of stock items sold column, column E. Then I'll go to format, and select conditional formatting. You'll see it's automatically applied my range, and I'm going to set my rule, so that, if the number in that column is greater than or equal to 90% I'll format the background color to orange, and I'll click done.

To start, let's get familiar with some basic vocabulary. When we're talking about relational databases, there are a few key terms you just need to know. First up, data. What is it exactly? Well, if we're being proper, data is the plural of the word datum, and a datum is defined as a piece of information. So data are pieces of information like your last social media post, whether that's text, images, or video, or the last phrase you search for on Google. Second, a database. It's simply a collection of data. That data can be organized in many different ways, but it's usually organized in tables. Now, what are tables? Well, that's the third key term you need to know. You know, in Trinidad, where I'm from, the word lime used as a term to mean you're hanging out. You're going to chill out with some friends. You're going to lime. When used like this, lime has absolutely nothing to do with the fruit. Similarly, in SQL, a table has nothing to do with the type you eat your food on. In the world of SQL, tables are made up of rows and columns. Rows run left to right and columns up and down, think Excel spreadsheet. Each row represents a single piece of data called a record.

Each column represents a specific attribute of that data, such as name or address. In order to get the data, take a look at it, and analyze it, we use a special language called SQL, short for Structured Query Language. By the way, SQL and SQL are terms used interchangeably that mean exactly the same thing. SQL includes many different commands or keywords. One of the most common is SELECT. The SELECT statement allows us to specify the columns we want to get from a table and include in our results. By understanding these basic concepts, you're on your way to mastering relational databases. So let's lime with some SQL.

Now, there are quite a wide variety of relational database management systems that are out there and the analogy I like to use is that of sneakers. Now, if you're a sneaker head like me, you're probably into a number of different brands like Nike or Reebok or Adidas. And much like a relational database management system, regardless of the brand, those sneakers perform a single function and that is to protect our feet. So an RDBMS, though",

Now, here are a few popular relational database management systems which you can research a bit for yourself simply by popping in the phrase relational database management system into Google like I have here. So there are quite a wide variety, but it makes some sense to just get a bit familiar with what they are. Within a relational database management system, there are areas that allow us to compose a SQL statement. So like the SQL statement that's in front of us here, there are some main components that we should just take a high level note of. So firstly, there are a number of different clauses in any given SQL statement. In this one, we have the SELECT clause, the FROM clause, and the ORDER BY clause. Now, within the SELECT clause, there can be one or more fields that are within this particular clause. In the FROM clause, you can have one or many tables inside of this particular clause. And lastly, the ORDER BY clause also houses one or more fields. Together, all three clauses comprise of a single SQL statement. Now, with regard to the number of different relational database management systems that are out there, there is a slight nuance of difference from one to the other when it comes to the syntax or the SQL statement that you compose within each.

Setting up your environment is a critical first step in learning any new coding language and SQL is no different. The course exercise file is a relational database that belongs to WSDA music, an online retail music company selling popular music. It contains product information like songs and albums, personal customer information, employee records, and sales data. Now, the company management wants to know if their database contains any useful information about sales, customer demographics, and any ways the company can improve or expand their services.

Secondly, I'd like to point out the importance of taking natural language questions and converting those into the equivalent SQL statement. So if you get a request from a manager or someone who's asking you about the data that you have stored, for instance how many customers do we have in our database? You would then take that natural question and convert it to the equivalent SQL query. That's an important job as a data analyst or an SQL practitioner and it helps you to take natural English language questions and then convert it to the equivalent SQL statement.

It's our relational database management system or RDBMS we'll be using for this course. There are a few reasons for choosing this software, but some of the main reasons are: SQLite is a free and open source database management system. Open source just means that the source code for this software is open to the public. DB Browser for SQLite is a visual tool that's used to create, design and edit database files compatible with SQLite. We'll be using DB Browser for SQLite for this course.

So, we can tell that there are 11 tables within our database and here they are listed out. One of the",

So with the example of the Album table, I've just expanded that and it shows that there are three fields or columns within this particular table. I can also tell the type of fields that each one of these are by looking under the Type column here. So, the album ID is an integer field and that simply means numeric or numbers are stored in this field. The Title column or field has an envar char or character type. And last but not least is the Artist ID which again has an integer stored. So quite a bit of information is housed within the database structure. Under the Schema, we can tell even more information, and that is that the album ID is not allowed to hold nulls or it's not allowed to be blank. The same thing holds for the title and the same thing holds for the Artist ID. Just from this database structure alone and expanding the table, I can tell quite a bit of information about our database. So this is actually the exact same method that I have employed over the past couple of decades when I enter a new environment and I'm trying to get familiar with a brand new database.

So one of the main differences here is, the database structure shows us the structure of the house so to speak, the framing, how it's built out. Now, the browse data tab is allowing us to see what is within that structure. So if you recall, we did take a look at the album table and saw that within the database structure there were three fields album ID, title, and artist ID.

The title is Vector Vixens Volume two and the artist ID is one. So browse data allows us to access these tables and get another point of view, a point of reference of what's housed within them.

I'm just typing in random words at the moment, but this is where we'll be composing our queries, and it is referred to as the query pane. Quite simple, but that's the name, the query pane. Down here, once we have a query composed, we will have an area to observe the results of that query. And in this area here, the second box is called the result pane, and this is where you can observe the result of executing a query. The last area here, where it says, \"Execution finished without errors,\" this is referred to as the messages pane. Very important, because if we compose a query, observe the result, the messages pane tells us if that query has run without error. It tells us how long that query took to run, and a lot of other vital information that's going to be useful to us as SQL practitioners. So, this Execute SQL tab, again, is the area that we will be spending quite a significant amount of time as we start practicing and getting to sharpen our skills as SQL practitioners.

What I'm referring to is comments. Comments are a plain or natural language way of describing a query that we have written. And there are two main ways of writing comments. There is a comment line which is written by starting with two dashes, followed by a comment, like this. So whatever follows these two dashes becomes a comment. The other way to write a comment is a comment block by doing a front slash star, then going a couple lines down, then do star front slash. Whatever falls between here becomes a comment. And I can go several lines down and anything falls between these blocks becomes a comment. I don't need to have two dashes as I do in the single line comment. Now, the way that you would format a comment is as follows. I would say, first, who created this? So you do created by, then you want to say, when was",

And in my case here, I'm going to show in my description that this is the structure of a basic query. Now, this is a very standard format of putting a comment before any SQL statement that you intend to compose. It's very helpful because often as a practitioner, you write several SQL statements and you may have found yourself forgetting what exactly any given one may do. This is a very simple, but effective way of reminding you of what exactly your query might be doing. Added to this, when others are working with queries that you have written, it gives them a very helpful clue into what exactly the query is doing. Another important point is queries can often be very long. You can have several hundreds of lines in terms of what's referred to as a SQL script, which can have one or many queries. And again, the comments is a really good way for you to clue yourself or others in as to what that query is doing.

So again, these are some just general high-level questions to start shaping our minds and getting ourselves ready to compose our query.

So let's put that as a description. First, last, and we should just say properly first and last names. Okay. So we want to have a query that's going to display all customer's first and last names, together with their email addresses. How would we begin to compose such a query? Well, if we start by going to the Database Structure tab, we can remind ourselves about the entire structure of this database. And if we recall, there are eleven tables. So one of the key things is to look at the names of these tables, which gives us some clue as to what might be housed within it. And our current request is asking for information or data from our customers. And as we go down the line here, we do see that we have a customer table. So when we expand this particular table, we can now see the fields or the columns that are the part of this particular table. Now in examining it, we do see that we have a first name which is what was requested, a",

So how would we now compose a SQL statement that's going to give us this result? Now let's go below our comment and start with the keyword \"from.\" Now, once I go to keyword \"from,\" and I want to specify from where. So now we have just confirmed that the customer table is the table that actually houses that information that we're after. Now I'm going to pause here and take a look at this popup that you'll probably have noticed as we were typing before. This is referred to as IntelliSense and this actually gives us the option to not type as much. And it's the job of IntelliSense to guess what we're actually typing, again with the aim of saving us some typing time. We're after the customer table which is denoted here by this symbol.

We want to start above that From clause with the keyword Select. Now under Select, we can now select the columns or the fields that we're interested in. Our request specifically is asking for first name. And there it is. You can now select that item. And it's also asking for last name. Because another column is going to be included in our result, I separate column names with a comma. I go down to the second line, and then I put last name and I select that option from our helpful IntelliSense. Finally, I want to see email addresses, so I repeat the process, add a comma, and add email, and select that item.

So in the composition of our SQL statement, we've done a few particular things that I wanted to draw to your attention. So I started with the FROM clause and what this does is point me in the direction of where the data is. So FROM Customer effectively says, go to the Customer table. And by putting SELECT up here and specifying the columns, it's effectively saying, well now that I'm at the Customer table, I'd like to see the first name, last name and email address displayed. And that's exactly what has happened. So let's talk a little bit about how this statement",

The same best practice that has us putting a comment before we start composing any SQL statement. There is nothing preventing this statement from being written all in one line. This will be perfectly legal. There'll be no syntax errors, if you put SELECT FirstName, LastName, Email FROM Customer all in one line. Nothing stops you from doing this, except a best practice. So why don't we put the sequel statement even though it works in one line? It seems like it might save some space. Well, the reason for this is readability. It's important the way that this syntax is laid out for the human eye. When it's laid out like this, we can clearly tell the distinct clauses, the SELECT clause, the FROM clause. We can clearly tell what's housed within each of those clauses. The SELECT houses three fields, the FROM has one particular table listed and this is very readable for not only ourselves who compose this SQL statement, but for others who's going to actually inherit this SQL statement from us. It also holds true for SQL statements that we'll inherit from others. When it's formatted according to this best practice, it helps us be that much more of a professional practitioner of SQL.

Column custom names https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-20685933/column-custom-names- 19069543?resume=false&u=24867419 - [Lecturer] Let's get into something that's pretty important with regard to communication of your query results. Now, often the technical language of a database will differ from the common language of a business. If we look at our example here the way that our WSDA music database stores the first name in the customer table is not in the most readable way. Now what I'm referring to is the column name. First name is all one word even though it really is two distinct words the same goals for last name. In SQL, we have ways of improving the communication of our results to our business audience. And we do this via something called aliases. Aliases allow us to rename our columns to names that are more appropriate to the business. So in our example here we have first name, last name, email, and WSDA Music Management usually refers to these particular columns as customer first name, customer last name and customer email. Now, how would we go about actually communicating these particular column names when we present our final query results? Well we introduce aliasing by way of the 'as' keyword we shall all place after the column name, first name. Then I will put",

Now I'm going to run this query, and what has happened? First name has now changed to what we have aliased that column to be, which is customer first name much more readable. And when we present this to management, there's no questions to be asked because we're speaking in their language. Let's do the same for last name. Now, slightly different than putting square brackets. I can also put open and closed quotes and put the name I'd like it to be, customer last name. Running this query again, let's observe the result. Now, our second column has now had its name updated to customer last name. Last but not least, let us do one more thing. I will now alias the email as uppercase email. Let's keep it at one word. But let's say that our management just prefers to see that email in upper case, in which case because it's just a single word. I don't need any square brackets, I don't need any quotes. I just simply put the one word that it altered from the original and I'm going to rerun this. And again, my email column is",

We have just formatted our brand new query and have aliased the columns, and now we're speaking in the language of the business. So our query looks pretty good, but we can still do a few things to improve our query result. Now WSDA Music Management loves our report, but they would like to have the results sorted by last name. How would we go about achieving this in SQL? Well, our first step is to include a brand new clause which comes after the from clause called the order by clause. By placing that clause there, and then specifying the column, we now want to order by which in this case is the last name, we can now sort our results. Now when it comes to sorting, we can go in one of two different ways. We can either sort ascending which is A to Z or descending order. And the ascending order sort is actually the default sort in SQL. So by me clicking on run, at this point, let's just take a note of the first record, which is Luis.",

What if we wanted to sort this column in descending order? Well, that's a simple change of including the keyword DESC after the last name. And now let's run this query. Customer Finn is now in position number one, and that is because his last name starts with a Z. And if you look at the customer last name, it's now sorted in descending order from Z through A. All right, great. Now we also have the ability to sort not only by one column but by multiple columns. So what if we had a scenario where we wanted to sort by first name in ascending order? In addition to this, we want to also sort by last name. To do that, I'm going to include a comma, go to the next line and specify the last name. And this is to be sorted in descending order. So I add that DESC. And now let's run this query. Looking at the results, it may not jump out",

Let's take a look at one more record here, John in 30 and 31. Two Johns, but when we look at the last name, G appears before D, and again, that's because of our descending order sort.

So these are all 60 rows or all of the records that are contained in the customer table. Often, management may be interested in not all 60 rows but maybe a subset.

So if I now include LIMIT and I simply put the amount of rows I'd like to limit my results by, and in this case, let's assume 10, I now simply are going to run this particular query.

When I run this, now we have 10 rows being displayed instead of 60. And if we look down here in our results pane, we see that is also reflected: 10 rows returned in 21 milliseconds. So this is often a very real-world request where you're asked to give the top 10 best performing sales, for instance, or top 10 customers. You are now enabled, with the use of the LIMIT keyword, to actually refine and limit the results that you present back to the requester of this information.

You could write a SQL query to select records from the customer table, sort the data alphabetically by last name, then, just manually count the names ending in B. Manually counting your results may be fine for a few records, but what if our database was much larger and contained millions of customers? Would you really want to manually count all the B names then? I don't think so. Fortunately, SQL has some tools that not only allow us to narrow down the results of our query to very specific data, but also to order and filter our data by conditions you specify. Let's see what these new statements can do. Okay, we've done quite a lot. What we're about to do next is enhance our ability to write queries by introducing a new clause called the where clause. Before getting into the where clause, it's important that we pause and take note of some of the common operators that will be used in conjunction with the where clause. So, there are three main operator types which fall under arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators. Under arithmetic operators, there is add, subtract, multiply, divide, and modulo. Some common comparison operators are equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to. And there are also logical operators which are",

Management at WSDA Music has asked, how many customers purchased two songs at 99 cents each? Well, if we zero in on this question, how many customers purchased two songs at 99 cents each, and when a customer purchases a track, that generates a transaction in the invoices table. So let's go over to the Browse Data tab and start by taking a look at the track table. Now, if we look over at the UnitPrice field, we do see that there are tracks at 99 cents each, which is part of our question, how many customers purchased two songs at 99 cents each? Now, two songs purchased at 99 cents each will total to $1.98. So let's take a look at our invoice table and if we scroll over to the total, we do see that there are invoices totaling $1.98.

Now in SQL, it is possible to search for partial values. And when we're searching for partial values, we include a new operator called the LIKE operator. Now, this comes in quite handy when we are searching for values that we're not quite sure of or a value is quite likely incorrectly spelled in our database, and we have to resort to such a search to get our results. Now, the management of WSDA Music is interested in how many invoices were billed in the cities that start with B. How will we go about responding to such a request with SQL? So the LIKE operator always works in conjunction with something that's referred to as the wild card character. So above our SQL statement, I'm just going to put a note in the form of a single line comment that says, \"The % is the wild card character.\" So in SQL, the % is referred to as a wild card character, and it always works in conjunction with the LIKE operator. So I'm just going to make a note here that the % is equivalent of saying, \"I don't care what",

And I'm interested in only the BillingCities that start with B. So I put a B there. And I don't care what comes after. I do care that the city starts with B, but whatever else comes after, I really don't care.

And if we take a look at our BillingCity, all 62 records now satisfy the one key criteria that we've specified, and that is that that BillingCity starts with a B. What comes after, we really don't care, but we do care that it starts with a B. And this is effectively performing a partial search and responding effectively to the current request by WSDA Music management,",

Now, management is getting very excited by the informative reports that you've been supplying to them. In a new twist, they have a brand new request. They'd like to know how many invoices were billed in cities that have a B anywhere in its name. How will we go about altering our current SQL statement to satisfy this request? Well, let's remind ourselves. The % or the wild card character is effectively saying, \"I don't care.\" So to respond to this current request, let's alter our current criteria, which is searching for BillingCities that start with a B. Now, if we alter this current SQL statement and enter another wild card character before the B, we're effectively saying this, \"I don't care what comes before the B, I don't care what comes after the B, I do care that there is a B somewhere in the BillingCity.\" So let's run our current altered SQL statement and observe the result. We have currently 62 rows. I'm going to run this statement and we've gone to 83 rows. And if we take a look at the BillingCity, we do see that there are some records that start with a B but some that do not, like Dublin. But what it does have is a B somewhere in this name, which is what our criteria has specified and our results are satisfying. Dublin, D-U-B, has a",

It doesn't start, doesn't end, it does have a B in there. Another quick note. You see that by specifying your criteria with a capitalized B, it returns all the records whether or not it's capitalized. So it is case insensitive. So our SQL statement, which we have now altered, effectively satisfies WSDA Music management's latest request, how many invoices were billed in cities that have a B anywhere in its name. And we could respond to management and say, \"There are 83 invoices that satisfy this criteria.\" Filter and analyze using dates https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-20685933/filter-and-analyze-using-dates- 19070423?resume=false&u=24867419 Selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to timestamp in the video - [Instructor] We have done some excellent work and performed quite a bit of analysis on numeric data.

As we see right here, it's stored year, followed by month, followed by day. But dates can easily be stored in other formats such as month, followed by day, followed by year. Or if stored as they do in Europe, we are looking at day, followed by month, followed by year. Another twisted date as we have in our current database is not only are our dates stored by year, followed by month, followed by day, but we also have the time included. Now let's jump over to our Database Structure tab and take a look at the invoice table again and look at our invoice date. If we look at the type, we see that the type that this data type is stored is date/time, and that is it is also including the time as part of what is stored within this field.

This is one of the key things we should pay attention to when we're responding to a query that's asking for multiple criteria, like the one that we're doing now. When it comes to multiple criteria, we should employ something that's referred to as PEMDAS. Most likely, if you're in the European part of the world, it's referred to as this, or BEMDAS if you're in the US.

For all the records that are satisfying this particular part of the criteria, if we observe, the billing cities that start with P all satisfy this criteria and that they're all above $1.98. But the billing cities that do not start with P, like Dublin here, does not satisfy this request. As it is, the request is saying just include any city regardless of what that invoice amount is once it starts with D, and that includes even the ones that are below $1.98. We are able to control our results by including brackets that satisfy the PEMDAS or BEMDAS rule. So now let's alter our SQL statement here, and do this. Instead of leaving it at as is, we're going to put brackets around this part of our criteria. Now, what this does is that it directs SQL to say, \"First, bring us all of the cities that satisfy this criteria.\" That is, all of the cities that start with P or start with D.

And if we take a look, we have every one of our criteria being above this amount. 1.99 seems to be the lowest so far, and I'm scrolling down all the way to the end, and we see that none of our records are below that $1.98. And this is a very important concept when it comes to the order of operation. When we have multiple criteria that's being asked for in our request, we must consider the order in which it is going to be executed.

To do that, let's include another keyword WHEN so when the total is between $2 and 6.99, then this bucket of category is going to be called low purchase.

You see, we've only been getting data from one table at a time thus far. And in relational databases, data is stored across multiple tables. Each table contains some, but not all of the information about our fictional company WSDA Music. So, for instance, if the company's management wanted a list of the support reps or employees that were assigned to each customer, to answer this request, we need the data stored in both the customer and employee tables.

This key icon is the symbol for a primary key. It's the unique identifying field for that particular table. Now, since the customer ID is the primary key of the customer table, there is a similar field in the invoice table. There is also, as we can see, a field called customer ID in the invoice table. Now, these two customer ID fields provide us with the link we need to access both of these tables simultaneously.

Invoice followed by the field customer ID, and we want to say equal to customer, and we want to specify the field within the customer table, which is the customer ID.

We also have a star symbol, and what this is is, instead of specifying a column that we want to return, this returns every single column that is in both the customer and invoice table. We are selecting all the fields from the invoice table and joining them to all the fields in the customer table. We use the keyword on to provide the query with the link between these two tables, which are the customer ID field in the invoice table to the customer ID field in the customer table.

There are a few things that we can observe, now that we've combined the invoice table to the customer table. Now, if we take a look at the invoice ID field from the invoice section of the results set, we can see that the first seven records are linked to the same customer. This is customer id number one. This link tells us that customer id number one is responsible for generating all seven of these invoices. If we scroll over to the customer portion of our result, we can tell who customer id number one is. And in this case, it's Mr. Lewis G. One customer is linked to many invoices. In the language of relational databases, we can say that the customer table has a one to many relationship with the invoice table. Now this makes sense when you think about it, seeing that a single customer can generate many invoices simply by purchasing multiple songs. We can observe the relationship between two tables of a relational database by looking at another way. And this is looking at what's referred to as a entity relationship diagram.

And what it is, is a graphical representation of the relationship between our tables. Now, if we take a look at the customer table and the invoice table, we can observe that there is indeed a relationship that is demonstrated by this line that is connecting them. If we take a look inside of the customer table, we do see that primary key field, designated by that key symbol next to the customer id field. In the invoice table, we see the primary key is the invoice id, but we do see that customer id field also in the invoice table. Now, to officially refer to this particular field, the customer id field, it is referred to as a foreign key. So the customer table is connected to the invoice table by means of a primary foreign key connection. And again, this symbol here shows that one customer can have many invoices. Now this is how an ERD demonstrates the relationship between multiple tables. If we take a look at the rest of our ERD, we can see many other instances of primary and foreign key relationships. Now joins would not be necessary if the invoice table had included all of the customer names. Now, why was this not done? If we go one step further, instead of a database with 13 tables, we can",

Well, the answer to this is, in a relational database, the process of distributing fields across related tables is known as normalization. And normalization keeps the size of our database small, as it reduces the need to duplicate or make mention of data in multiple places. Okay, now this becomes significant when saving seconds of processing time when we construct our queries. Considering the staggering size of some databases, every second does indeed count. Imagine if your Google search took five minutes rather than a few seconds. Now that we have identified the common link between the two related fields in both the invoice and customer table, let's take a closer look at how we would write join syntax that would be a little more efficient. Simplifying JOINs https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-20685933/simplifying-joins- 19067618?resume=false&u=24867419 - [Instructor] So we've seen from our example that's in front of us, our first example that joins have a special syntax when referring to field names. Since two tables in any given database may have fields with the identical names, when creating joins, we must specify the table name followed by the column name that we would like to join so that the SQL browser knows exactly which version of the field we are referencing. Now this syntax requires that the table name be listed first followed by the column or field name. Now joins are often used with",

Here we have the invoice, and I'm just going to do as we do a column name and introduce the keyword as, and because this is invoice, let's call this I. Down here in the customer area, let's alias this customer table as C. Let's revisit our syntax that comes after the on keyword. We have the invoice table followed by the customer ID field. Because we have just aliased the invoice table as I, instead of fully typing out invoice, I simply have to say I at this point. The same thing can occur for the customer table, which is also aliased as C. So instead of typing out full customer, I just simply put C. As you would suspect down here in the order by, I would also say C.customerid. Now as we mentioned before, the star returns all of the records from all of the tables.

We've identified the primary key of the customer table, identified a similar foreign key in the invoice table, and then we used the ON keyword to link the two tables together, hoping that the data matches up. Now consider this: what happens if the data from the tables we join does not match up completely? And here's what I mean by this. What if we had a customer, let's call him customer 6, delete his WSDA music account and was subsequently removed from the customer table altogether. Because WSDA music is required to keep financial records, there's still evidence from the",

    "text": "invoice table that customer 6 made a purchase at some point. It's not unusual to find discrepancies in a database and we must decide whether we want our query to include data that does not match up or exclude it altogether. To handle discrepancies between tables, different types of joins are used. To understand this concept, it's helpful to look at join types using a slightly simplified version of our invoice and customer table. As we look at our simplified invoice and customer tables, we can identify a few discrepancies. First, our invoice table shows that someone with a customer ID of 6 made a purchase on May 1st, 2017 but this customer does not appear in our customer table. Also, it appears that customer 1 and customer 5 never made a purchase at all. Since those customer ID numbers do not show up in the invoice table, customer 2 shows up twice so we can infer that this customer made two purchases. Since the records for customer 1 and customer 5 exist in the customer table but they do not exist in the invoice table and customer 6 only exist in the invoice table, each table contains at least one unique record that does not exist in the other table. Now we can attempt to join these two tables together and observed how the output is handled depending on which type of join we use. Let's start with our familiar inner join. The INNER JOIN https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-20685933/the-inner-join- 19070438?autoplay=true&resume=false&u=24867419 - [Narrator]",

    "text": "So let's talk about the inner join. An inner join only returns matching records. Any unmatched data from either table is ignored. Joins are often described with the use of Venn diagrams. As our Venn diagram shows, an inner join represents only the overlapping section of the Venn diagram. Now, if we take a look at our simplified invoice and customer tables, we can see that our inner join will ignore invoice number five. And that is because this invoice refers to customer six, and this customer does not appear in our customer table. Likewise, customer one and customer five from the customer table did not generate any invoices. In other words, they do not have any records in the invoice table. So that record is ignored as well. As the Venn diagram shows, only the overlapping data is included. Now, if we revisit the code that we generated to produce this inner join, we can see that this is the exact SQL statement that we created when we first visited our inner join. Now, if we take a look at the output of this query, we can see that only four records were returned. Invoice number five, customer number one, and customer number five are all omitted. Customer number two is responsible for two records. Now, the inner join is the most common type of join that's used, and the main use of the inner join is to bring corresponding data together from different tables in a relational database.",

As shown in our Venn diagram, the concept of left table and right table depends entirely on the order these tables are listed in the join statement. So for example, our SQL statement here has listed invoices first. Then after the left outer join, it lists the customer table. And in this instance, our invoice table is the left table and our customer table is the right table. With this type of join, everything in our invoice table will be displayed. Since customer one did not order any songs, that particular record is omitted. However, as we can see in our simplified invoice and customer table, we are combining all five records from the invoice table with only three records from the customer table. Remember, there is no record for customers number one or number five in the invoice table, and customer number two has produced or purchased two songs and created two invoice records. Unlike the inner join, which matched an equal number of records between each table, let's now take a look at the output of this query to understand how the SQL browser handles it. Now, this SQL query or syntax for the left outer join is very similar to what we've used for the inner join.",

Now, when we take a look at the output of the left outer join, we see that the SQL browser has added nulls or null data to our results set. Remember that we have no information in the customer table about customer six. Adding null data is how the SQL browser handles the fact that we are trying to match five records from the invoice table to only four records from the customer table. Left joins are useful because they allow us to see discrepancies in our data. We can produce lists of customers that have not generated invoices or search for data that has been removed in the right table but still exist in the left. Now let's move on to take a look at right outer joins. The RIGHT JOIN https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-20685933/the-right-join- 19071400?autoplay=true&resume=false&u=24867419 - [Instructor] Now before getting into our right outer join, I wanted to remind you about something we mentioned in the beginning of the course with regard to relational database management systems. If you recall, we did mention there are various types of relational database management systems, such as the one we're using for this course, SQL Light. But there are others like Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle. And we mentioned that there is about a 5% difference with regard to the syntax that you would write in one RDBMS versus another.

But since right joins are still very popular in other relational database management systems I think it's appropriate to include it in our discussion here. Now, the right outer join returns the entire right table as well as matching information from the left table. The right join is a mirror image of the left join, and functions in a very similar way. Now, similar to what occurred in the left join, the right join takes all fields from the right table, in this case the customer's table, and matches that data with any corresponding data from the invoice table or the left table. Now again, if we look at our simplified invoice and customer table, since customer six does not exist in the customer table, this record is simply ignored. The SQL statement required to create a right join is not surprisingly, similar to the other two joins we've shown thus far. If we take a look at the syntax here, all we have done to create a right join again is replace left outer join, as we did previously, with right outer join. Now, this particular join returned the most records out of the three joins we've demonstrated thus far. Customer number one and customer number five did not have corresponding data in the invoice table. So null values were assigned to those records.

Now right joins are used less frequently than left joins, and since SQL Light does not recognize the right join, it is a best practice to reverse the order of the tables in your query which would actually give you the same result. We'll demonstrate this a little later. Now, so far we've taken a look at inner join, left join, and right join. And in all of our examples thus far, we've been joining just two tables. Well, it is possible to perform joins on more than two tables, so let's take a look at how we would generate the sequel syntax to do this.

Adding additional tables using joins is pretty straightforward. All we need to do is follow the same pattern as the inner joins we have already demonstrated. A great place to start when planning to write a join is the ERD or entity relationship diagram to first understand how tables may be related. We can see that in addition to the relationship between the invoice and customer tables, there is also a relationship between the support rep ID from the customer table and the employee ID from the employees table. Now, even though these two fields are called completely different names, when you think about the context of these names in the tables that they",

And in the employee table that same support rep is referred to as an employee. So when referring to customers, that same person is referred to as the customer's support rep. But internally, that same support rep can be referred to as an employee. Okay, now let's consider the following scenario. Let's say that WSDA Music customer service department wants to reward the employees that are responsible for the 10 highest individual sales. Customer service wants to create a plaque for each employee with a list of the customers that they've helped. Now that we have an operational scenario, we can look at the ERD diagram to determine what fields we need in our query. Now, sometimes when we are writing out complex query that reference or access multiple tables, it's helpful to think through what fields are needed and what tables those fields come from. In the following diagram, we have laid out some of the fields that were needed just to conceptually visualize what we're going to do when it comes to writing our statement. So under the fields we need we've identified that we need from the employee table the employee first name, last name, and the employee ID. On the right here, we have a little preview of how we're going to alias those particular column names from the employee table. All of them are proceeding with",

The third table that we need is the invoice table, and we have also identified the fields that we need from this table which are customer ID and total purchase amount. The columns, as we will format it in our SQL statement is I to represent the invoice table dot field name, customer ID and total. We also want to explain how we are going to present these records, and we can say that we'll sort the query by highest invoice value and limit to the top 10 invoices. Okay.

You just got through joins. That's a job well done, and I know because joins were my biggest pain point when I first got started with SQL. Now think about the following request. How many customers do we have whose last name starts with S? To answer this request with SQL one approach would be to select the last name's field from the customer's table, order by last name, scroll down to the S names, and then count those names manually. Another approach would be to filter our results to return only Last names starting with S, using the where clause which would make the counting process easier. Both these methods require some sort of manual counting to get the answer to the request. In this chapter I'll show you how to use something called functions to simplify your calculations and eliminate the need for you to do any manual counting, functions are one of the most powerful features of SQL.

Now, when I type in the keyword or the function UPPER, then open parenthesis, we do see this popup in front of us which is telling us a little bit more about the UPPER function and what it expects. Now, most functions in DB Browser have popup information that's very helpful in determining what arguments the function takes and what the function actually does. Now let's start exploring some of the various functions starting with string function. Connecting strings https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-20685933/connecting-strings- 19070441?resume=false&u=24867419 - [Instructor] Now, to demonstrate the use of string functions, we can take a look at the following scenario. Now, let's say our managerial team at WSDA Music is interested in sending out personalized postcards to each one of their US-based customers. Now, to do this, we would need a single field that comprises of the customer's first name, last name, address and that would be their full address which would include the street, the city, the state, and the zip code. Let's see how we could use our SQL string functions to build this field. Now, when it comes to joining separate fields, this is referred to as concatenating them in SQL. And to achieve this, we use the double pipe operator in SQLite. I'm going to make a quick single line comment just to demonstrate that the double pipe is",

Let's put a new comma in our SELECT clause and then start building our new field. First, we need the first name, so I'm going to put FirstName, then I'm going to use the double pipe operator like this, then I'm going to put the LastName. So by doing this, we'll effectively join two separate fields together. Let's now observe the result here. Okay, we now have a new field and this field has the first and last name fields in one single field. The only issue is we don't have it looking very readable without a space between the first and the last name. So let's go ahead and modify our current statement. To do this, we would need to now put a pair of single quotes with a space in between. We want to make sure and have that space in between. And then we're going to put another pair of double pipe and make sure that LastName is there. And now let's rerun our statement. What we've done is created a space between the first and last name and that looks a lot more readable to the human eye. Okay, let's continue building out our mailing address.

And then between the double pipes, we want not just a space, but we want also a comma there. So we want it formatted slightly different by putting a comma in between. And now let's put city and let's run our query. Okay, now, if we extend our result here, we do see we have the street, followed by a comma then the city. Let's continue and then put the state. So by now, we're just repeating the pattern. No comma this time. And we put state. And finally, let's put the zip code. Repeat the pattern once more. And the zip code is referred to as the postal code in our customer table. Now let's run our full concatenated address. And we do have a complete address that looks nicely formatted. First and last name, followed by street, city, state, and zip. Last but not least, let's give our new column a nice title and call it mailing address. One more time, we will rerun this.

And in this way, we have done something very significant and a very common action with regard to manipulating data in an existing database via string functions. Separating text https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-20685933/separating-text- 19071411?resume=false&u=24867419 - [Lecturer] In addition to joining or concatenating strings of text we can do the reverse of this which is to truncate or shorten a string of text. Now, we can achieve shortening or truncating a string of text by the use of understanding how text is stored in a text field. One important concept to understand is that text have positions in a stored field. So for instance, our first name field that has Frank the letter F sits in position number one and R two, A three, and so forth. Now this positioning matters when it comes to manipulating strings of text. Now, let's say our management at WSDA Music is really happy about our mailing list, however, they want to actually have a little more precise postal codes. If you notice, the current postal codes all have a dash and some numbers following and these numbers are usually referred to as the zip+4 code. And this isn't necessary for mail to find their way to the intended recipient. So let's go ahead and remove this zip+4 code and let's start our removal of this by employing one new string function. So first, let's take a look at the length of this postal code. And to do this, we're",

Now, if we take a look at these lengths, they all vary and that is because they don't always have the equal number of digits. If we take a look at row number five, the zip+4 code is actually three digits, whereas in other cases it's four digits. So we can actually start our removal of parts of the zip code by employing the sub string function. I'm going to go into a new line here and start typing, S, U, B, S, T, R and open parenthesis. And this sub string function actually removes the extra US postal codes from this particular field. To do this, we're going to say first, the field that we want to manipulate or change which is the postal code. Then we specify the first digit that we want to start the removal, which is from digit number one or position number one.

Here we now have a new postal code and this time it's nicely formatted to only the first five digits, which as we can verify here is exactly what we wanted to do. Now we could respond to WSDA Music Management and say here is the updated mailing list with a nicely updated and cleaner five digit postal code.

First, let's take a look at the UPPER function, and the UPPER function simply takes a string of text and converts it to upper case. So, let's take the FirstName field and make this field upper case. So, just simply putting the field name between the parenthesis of the upper function let's make sure and include our extra comma to accommodate this new field, and let's even alias this to call it First Name All caps. Now, let's run this newly updated statement. We have our new field First Name All caps, and if you take a look at the contents, it now has all of our first",

Okay, one more string function which is the opposite of UPPER, which is LOWER. The LOWER function simply converts a string of text to all lowercase. Now, let's do this for our LastName field and let's alias this as Last Name All lower. Now, let's run this updated SQL statement and we now have our newly created field, Last Name All lower, and the values show, as it says, all values are now all lowercase. So, two other powerful string functions to add to our knowledge base, and with that, we've now wrapped up our discussion on string functions. Next, let's take a look at date functions. Date functions https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-20685933/date-functions- 19069542?resume=false&u=24867419 - [Speaker] Now date functions allow us to manipulate data that's stored in various date and time formats. Now, if you recall within our WSDA Music database the dates that we have stored in this database are stored in both date and time. And that is year, month, day followed by hour, minute, and second. Now, let's say that we were tasked by the management at WSDA Music to calculate the employees ages. That is, we need to leverage the birth date field to calculate each employee's age. Now, to do this, we need to find out the difference between the current date and the employee's birthdate. To perform such a calculation, we can employ a",

So, to operate this function properly, you need to pass into it two arguments, and that is, first, you need to pass in your desired format, that is the format you'd like to format the date in together with the time string to be formatted. So, let's now take our current SQL statement here, which is simply selecting a few fields from our employee table, and modify it to now include the strftime function to calculate our employee's birthdays. Now, our first step would be to include a brand new column and then introduce the strftime function. Now we need to supply the format that we intend to format this particular field as, and we want to format this as year, month, day. To do that, we place a pair of single quotes, then inside the single quotes, we put a percent, capital Y for year, then a dash, percent, M for the month, and then another dash, percent, D for the date. This tells our field how we want it formatted. Next, we place a comma and we place the time string. In this case, we are placing the birth date for our employee. Now, we can also go ahead one step further and alias this particular column as birth date, no time code. Now let's go ahead and run our query here. Now, if you take a look",

So, let's now introduce yet another column, and to do this calculation, we simply need to introduce a subtraction where we are subtracting the present date from the employee's birth date. Let's start again by introducing the strftime function, and we're going to format things the exact same way, and that is year, followed by month, followed by day. Now, instead of the birth date, we want the present date. To get the present date, we introduce a new function in between a pair of single quotes as well, and that is the now function. And the now function simply reads the present date that it receives from your computer and presents this date to be calculated. Next, we want to subtract this from the employee's birthdate. So, we're simply going to repeat the previous strftime function we did for birth date, no time code. So, let's repeat strftime, and now, present the same formatting, which is percent y, percent month, and percent day.

So with this completed, we can now return to the management at WSDA Music and say, here is our latest report that now calculates the ages of every employee. Aggregate functions https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-20685933/aggregate-functions- 19065708?resume=false&u=24867419 - [Instructor] Let's take a look at another type of function called aggregate functions. Aggregate functions turn a range of numbers into a single point of data based on a variety of mathematical operations. Now let's take a look at an example where we would use our invoice table to calculate the grand total. In other words, let's say we were tasked by WSDA Music Management to get our total global sales of all time. How would we go about constructing a SQL statement to do this? Well, let's first start with our usual from clause, and because we're interested in the total sales, this information is held inside of our invoice table. So let's specify the invoice table after our from, then let's go above our from and specify the select. Now we can introduce our sum aggregate function to calculate the grand total for us. So let's specify sum, and then within parentheses, we want to",

Now this is now effectively responding to WSDA Music Management, their latest request, which is to generate the total global sales of all time. And here we have a report that is responding to this question. Now there are a number of other popular aggregate functions that we should get familiar with as well. So let's go ahead and modify this present statement to include a few more aggregate functions. Let's introduce the average function, which is AVG, and then we'll perform the average on the same column which is the total. Let's alias this as average sales. Now let's take a look at this. Let's rerun our statement, and we now see we have a new column with the average sales. Okay, let's introduce a few more aggregates. Let's go with the max aggregate function, and we'll do this to the same field again, and we could call this the maximum sale. Now let's run this statement and we have now $1,000.86 as our maximum sale amount. Let's include the minimum aggregate function, and we'll call this minimum sale.

Okay, with this, let's go ahead and now run our statement. And now we have the various values that are being triggered via the use of our various aggregate functions. We have total sales, average sales, maximum sale, minimum sale, and a total count of sales. Now this is a very good use of aggregate functions. We're going to take a look at one more use of our functions and see how we can make them a little more efficient by doing what's referred to as nesting them. Nesting functions https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-20685933/nesting-functions- 19072328?resume=false&u=24867419 - [Instructor] Now let's take a look at another useful aspect of functions. What I'm referring to is nesting of functions. A nested function is a function that's contained within another function. Now if you recall from our last example which is still in front of us here, we used a number of different aggregate functions to perform different calculations. And if you take a look at the average function, when we look at the result for this, we do see that we have quite a number of digits after our decimal place. Now this is a great candidate to employ nesting, and we could clean",

An appropriate function here is a new function called the round function, and what the round function does is that it returns a floating point value rounded to the number of digits that you specify. So let's go ahead and employ this new function and nest our current average function. To start doing this, I'm going to create some space in our average function line here and introduce this round function. I'm going to say open parenthesis, and all that I'm going to do is go completely past our current average function, and now I'm going to say a comma at this point. And then I'm going to apply how many digits do I want to round this value to? Then I'm going to close off this function. Now before running this, let's take a look here. We have our original average function and now we have our newly added round function which actually surrounds it. And this round function expects two parameters which is the value to be rounded which is our average value now currently with many digits after the decimal point. And now we are going to limit it to just two decimal places with the use of this second argument in our round function. Now let's go ahead and run our statement here.

Now, looking at the invoice table of our WSDA Music database, we know that we can get the average amount for an invoice very easily with the use of a AVG function. Now, let's say that we had a new request from the WSDA Music Company management and they have asked us to calculate the average invoice amount by BillingCity. Now, let's take a look at how we would respond to such a request with SQL. As we usually do, let's start with the FROM clause. And we are interested in invoice amounts so let's go to the Invoice table. Now, above the FROM, I'm going to include our SELECT. And now, let's include the fields that we want to display.

Okay, when we take a look at this result here, something seems not quite right. Now, we wanted to view the average invoice amount for each individual city in our invoice table. Even though we included the BillingCity in our SELECT statement, the query is still only giving us the global average for all invoices. Now, why isn't our query returning the average total for every city in our invoice table? To solve this puzzle, let's take a look at what we are really asking the SQL Browser to do. The question we were asked was, what is the average invoice total by city? Now, if we take a look at our query here, we ask the SQL Browser for two items in the invoice table. First, we asked the Browser to list every city that's in the BillingCity field. Next, we asked the Browser to give us the average of the total field. The first request would produce",

Now, we didn't get the information we wanted because we didn't quite construct our query the right way. We can fix this issue by including the GROUP BY clause to our query. Let's do that now. So the GROUP BY clause always follows the FROM. So I'm going to include GROUP BY. And we want to group by the field or the column that is not aggregated. So if we take a look in our SELECT clause here, we have an aggregated value, the total, and we also have a nonaggregated, the BillingCity. And the rule of thumb here, when we're including a GROUP BY clause here, we want to apply the GROUP BY clause to the nonaggregated field, which in this case is BillingCity. One more thing we'll do is include the ordering of our results. So let's ORDER BY the same field, which is BillingCity. And we're going to order in ascending order, and that is a default so we don't have to specify that. Now, let's take a look at running our updated query and observe the result. Now we have 54 rows.

And after this AVG function, you're going to put a comma and the value we want to round to, which is two decimal places. And now, let's rerun our query with our nested function.

Now we can achieve the result of this request by making some alterations to our existing SQL statement. Let's go ahead and add a Where clause to our query.

    "text": "we will need to use criteria on fields that have been aggregated, for instance, like our average total here. So let's say we have a new twist in the request from WSDA Music Management. They have now asked us to find all average totals that are greater than $5. How would we go about doing this? But first, let's update our question. We want all average invoice totals greater than five bucks and let's include our dollar sign there. Okay, what are the average invoice totals that are greater than $5? Now, this is just an alteration of our present WHERE clause, which is presently searching for only the billing cities that begin with L. So let's remove this current criteria and instead include the new criteria which is the average total or the average invoice amount and we want only the ones that are greater than $5. Now let's observe our query result with this update. What has happened? We have this new error message being displayed to us. We have no result. We have a lot of red under the lines that we've placed here in our query editor. And if we look at our messages window, we do see a clear error. \"Execution finished with errors. Misuse of aggregate.\" And it specifies the average aggregate function. So this error message tells us, at least in this case, that we cannot use the WHERE clause to create a condition based on an aggregate function. Now, if we want",

Now, the HAVING clause always comes after the GROUP BY clause. So let's now modify our query to reflect this. So instead of having the WHERE clause, and let me just create some space so that we see things a little more clearly, let's now remove the WHERE clause altogether. And instead, we will include the HAVING clause. So one thing to keep in mind is that the HAVING clause always comes after the GROUP BY. So I'm going to close the gap of the GROUP BY, I'm going to create some space under it between the GROUP BY and the ORDER BY clause, and now I'm going to include the keyword HAVING. And now I'm going to include exactly what we had in our WHERE clause attempting to get our new filter, which in this case is the aggregate average of the invoice amount, which is the total. And we want only those values that were greater than $5. So here we have our updated statement. A little tough to see, but let's run it now and observe the result. We now have a new result here. No errors. And if we take a look at the average amount being displayed here, it's all over the $5. Now let me close the gaps in our SQL statement and take a look at the",

    "text": "full SQL statement. So we have now a SELECT clause. We do have our FROM clause, but we do have our grouping as well. And our new clause called the HAVING clause is now included and we have now our aggregate function in this particular clause. Grouping with the WHERE and HAVING clause https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-20685933/grouping-with-the-where-and-having-clause- 19072331?resume=false&u=24867419 - Now a simple way of explaining the difference between the WHERE versus the HAVING clause is the WHERE clause is for filtering non aggregate data and the HAVING is for filtering results that contain aggregates. Now, a more detailed way to describe this difference is that two types of filtering occur when both a WHERE and a HAVING clause are included in the same query. The WHERE clause tells the query what information to include from the table. Then once the information is filtered and aggregate functions are applied to the fields the HAVING clause acts as a further filter for the aggregated data. Now, let's take a look at this and add a little twist to our current request from WSDA Music management. They would now want the exact result that we have here but only for the cities that start with B. So let's alter our question here. What are the average invoice totals greater than $5 for cities starting with B? Now we already have our query filtering for the average totals that are greater than five. Now we need to include the filter for only cities that start with B.",

So I'm going to say WHERE and now I want where the billing cities that start with B. So I'm going to say billing city and I want to include my LIKE it's a text field. I'm including my single quotes and I want the ones that start with B. I include my wild card because I don't care what comes after B. I do care that it starts with a B. Now, let's now run our query. We now have updated results eight rows and as we can see all our billing cities start with B and all of our average invoice amounts are greater than five. Now, in this query we just performed we have done the same task as we did before but this time we added the WHERE clause to filter results to only the cities that start with B. This filtering step is performed before the HAVING and ORDER BY clauses are processed. Since we must filter before we can group the order of these filtering clauses is important and the WHERE is most always coming before the HAVING.

So let's take a look at modifying our existing SQL statement to respond to WSDA Music's latest request. And here we have it. What are the average invoice totals by billing country and city? As we have our query set up now we are responding to a grouped by billing city result. The current request also wants us to include the billing country. So let's do that. In our select we're going to also include the billing country. Let's put our comma. And now, because we now went from one non aggregated field to two, we must now include both of these non aggregated fields in our group by clause. So let's go ahead and include billing country. And we are going to separate the two fields with a comma and include the billing city which has already been there. With this alteration let's go ahead and now run our statement. Now, if we take a look at our result we now have some more detailed information. We now have our billing city as well as billing country and the associated average amounts. Let's make one slight alteration to our existing query because we are starting with countries and we'd like to see what cities fall in between them, let's order our results by billing country instead of",

So where we see Brazil appearing many times, if we look over in the city, there are the various cities within Brazil. And over here we have the associated average invoice amount per city. So we have a much more granular look into our data. We could see the same for Canada. We have the various cities within Canada being displayed along with their associated average invoice amounts. So by doing this simple alteration to our existing SQL statement, we have now given ourselves an even deeper level of analysis. And WSDA Music Management is thrilled by the level of detail that they can now conduct some proper research.
